# ASP.Net
# Gift Article Store Registration Page

This is a simple registration page for an online gift article store built using ASP.NET Web Forms.

## Overview

The registration page allows users to sign up for an account by providing a username, email, and password. It includes validation to ensure that the required fields are filled in and that the email has a valid format.

## Files

- **Default.aspx**: This is the markup file for the registration page. It contains the HTML markup for the user interface elements.
- **Default.aspx.cs**: This is the code-behind file for the registration page. It contains the C# code that handles user interactions and backend functionality.

## Usage

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to the `Registration.aspx` file to view the registration page markup.
3. Navigate to the `Registration_UI.cs` file to view the code-behind logic for the registration page.
4. Run the project to launch the registration page in your web browser.
5. Fill in the registration form and click the "Register" button to create a new user account.

## Customization

- You can customize the registration page by modifying the markup in the `Registration.aspx` file.
- You can add additional functionality or validation by editing the code-behind logic in the `Registration_UI.cs` file.
- Remember to implement proper security measures, such as hashing passwords before storing them in the database, and to validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
